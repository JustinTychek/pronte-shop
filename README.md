# pronte-shop

a single page, e-commerce website

For this site, I wanted to create a sleek, modern design that would be easy for users to navigate. By using a calming color pallet, I wanted to make users relaxed when browsing. The single page, scrolling layout allows for users to stay on track when navigating the site.

I believe that my decisions in this project would provide lots of value for my client. The structure of my code and styling is easily readable and organized. In addition, I made sure to properly allocate my time to ensure that everything would stay on schedule.

My audience for this site is adults and families with children. I wanted to give them easy access to purchasing clothing items through my design, as well as allow them to find out information about the seller and contact the seller.
